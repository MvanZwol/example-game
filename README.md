## Push Changes from local to remote

- go to your directory with your project
- type git add . (to 'save' all your changes)
- type git commit -m "type here your commit messages, it can be anything" (to commit your changes)
- type git push (to push your changes to the remote)
- now I can pull those changes and pick up where you left off
